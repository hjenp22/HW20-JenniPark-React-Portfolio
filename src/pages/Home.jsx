          Originally a Magna Cum Laude graduate in Biology Pre-Health Sciences
          from Saint Xavier University, I soon discovered my true passion lies in
          the dynamic world of technology and development. Through platforms like
          Codecademy, I've been honing my skills, and now I'm diving even deeper
          into software engineering at Northwestern University's Full Stack Coding
          Program, set to graduate in late March 2024.
